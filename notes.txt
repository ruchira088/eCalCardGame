Assign the game Id to the web socket, so then it is not necessary to for the client to be aware of the game ID in the game invitation step.

Include the webSocket for players in the players object of a CardGame rather than having a separate Map.

Use HandleBars to create the winning and losing modal dialogs in games.

Think about when to remove the CardGame from the gameMap.
